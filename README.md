CMD-Calibration
===============

Calibrates raw CMD Mini Explorer EM data against a calibration curve and sets various options for gridding etc.  Raw and calibrated data sets are outputted.

This program is built upon Finn's calibration software from 2012.

Launch the cmdUI.py file to get monitoring of what the program is doing as it does it.  Program also launches straight from GUI.py

It allows you to calibrate a raw file against a calibration curve and set various options for gridding etc.

Raw and calibrated data sets are outputted.

Raw data can also be viewed in saved.

The CSV files outputted by the calibration of the data can also be combined to generate larger data sets, providing all have been calibrated against the same curve, new combined data files can be outputted.

Data is outputted as a CSV file transformed into OS coordinates
Shapefiles of raw and calibrated data can be produced, along with projection files
ArcGIS ascii grids can be exported, projection information is also created
Ascii Surfer grids can be generated
Georectified transparent PNGs can be generated.  These have accompanying world files and projection information (and can drop into GIS/CAD)
Topo data can be exported as both Surfer and ArcGIS ASCII grids (it is also contained within the shapefiles)
